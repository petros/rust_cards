# Rust Cards

This is my attempt to capture interesting bits and pieces as I am learning Rust. I will not capture every single detail. Here are some examples of what you may find here:

- Things that are unique to Rust compared to other languages I know
- Rust concepts that are difficult to understand
- Idiomatic Rust examples

## Companion

I am also posting the cards as images under [a section on My Rust Journey](https://rust.petrolidas.com/cards/all-cards) site.

Learning Rust is part of a bigger decision I've made at the end of 2022. I quit being a people manager after a 12 year break from a 12 year career as a programmer (it started in 1998). With the goal to become a full time programmer again. I am writing [a series of posts](https://petros.blog/series-being-a-programmer-again/) to share my experience.
